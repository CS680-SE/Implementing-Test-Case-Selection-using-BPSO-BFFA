##Adaptive Test Case Selection - Data Sets

These data sets contain information on test case executions and results from the past. It can be used to assess test case priority and selection methods, as well as identify test cases that are most likely to fail on their next run. The duration of a test case's execution, its most recent execution time, and the outcomes of its most recent executions are used to define it.

ABB Robotics Norway provided two of these data sets; the other was published by Google and is included here in its converted form.



| Data Set          | Test Cases    | CI cycles | Verdicts | Failed |
| :---------------- |:-------------:| :--------:| :------: |-------:|
| ABB Paint Control | 89            |    352    | 25,594   | 19.36% | 
| ABB IOF/ROL       | 1,941         |    320    | 30,319   | 28.43% | 
| Google GSDTSR     | 5,555         |    336    | 1,260,617| 0.25%  |

### File Format
The data sets are provided in CSV format (with a ';' delimiter). Because we're looking for failures, test results show True for failed runs and False for successful runs to make our product easier to use.

|    Cycle          | The CI cycle to which this test execution belongs.                                      |   
|     Id            | Each test execution has a Unique numeric identifier                                     |      
|     Duration      | The test case's estimated runtime                                                       |
